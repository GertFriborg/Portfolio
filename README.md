Hello!

In this repository are some projects I've worked on during my stay at De La Salle University. 
These projects were done in partial fulfillment of requirements under my Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Data Modeling, or Machine Learning classes. 
In the future, I plan to add more projects and either update or improve those listed here.

The works here can be found in the different folders above.
